# blackjack
Basic blackjack game. Single deck. No bets. No splits or doubles. No insurance.

I wanted to try to create a simple blackjack game.

There are no bets in this game so no tracking of money. Purely the blackjack game logic.
Later could add money tracking, bets, and more complex gameplay such as splitting
doubling down and insurance bets.

Struggled with Aces being worth 1 or 11 but this solution seems to be working.
